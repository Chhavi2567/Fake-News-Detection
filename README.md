# Fake News Prediction

## About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

1. **id**: Unique identifier for a news article.  
2. **title**: Title of the news article.  
3. **author**: Author of the news article.  
4. **text**: Content of the news article (may be incomplete).  
5. **label**: Indicates whether the news article is real or fake:  
   - `1`: Fake news  
   - `0`: Real news  

## Project Overview
This project aims to classify news articles as real or fake using machine learning techniques. The key steps include:

- **Importing Dependencies**: Preparing the necessary Python libraries and packages.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to prepare it for model training.  

## Features of the Project
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
- Data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values and text tokenization.
- Implementation of machine learning models for classification.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.

## Results
- The model effectively distinguishes between real and fake news articles.
- Performance metrics are detailed in the notebook.
